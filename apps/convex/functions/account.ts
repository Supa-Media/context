/**
 * Account deletion.
 *
 * One public mutation: the caller deletes *themself*. There is deliberately no
 * "delete this user" argument — an account is not something one person removes
 * for another, and an args-free mutation structurally cannot be aimed at
 * anybody but the identity on the request.
 *
 * ## What "delete my account" means for a workspace
 *
 * A workspace is the unit that owns a context (see CLAUDE.md, "The workspace
 * model"), so the question per membership is: does this context still have an
 * owner once I am gone?
 *
 *  - **I am the only owner** → the context dies with me. Everything hanging
 *    off the workspace goes: the storage binding (the customer's bucket is
 *    untouched — we only forget the credential), connect attempts, ingestion
 *    policy and tickets, invitations, grants, the audit trail, every
 *    membership, the slug's row in `names`, and the workspace row itself.
 *    Freeing the slug is the point, not a nicety: the shared namespace has no
 *    other release path, and a deleted account must not squat a name forever —
 *    the person may well re-onboard under it.
 *  - **Somebody else also owns it, or I am not an owner at all** → the context
 *    is not mine to take down. Only my own membership row goes.
 *
 * ## The rule this file must not break
 *
 * This is a public mutation and it must never touch `decryptSecret` — see
 * `__tests__/structure.test.ts`. A Dropbox binding's grant still has to be
 * revoked at Dropbox (otherwise our copy of the credential is forgotten while
 * the authorization lives on in the person's account), and that is done the
 * way `disconnectStorage` does it: the revocation is *scheduled*, envelope in
 * the args because the row is deleted in this transaction, and scheduling is
 * not calling — the scheduler discards the job's result, so no credential can
 * flow back here.
 *
 * Deletion is idempotent-safe within the call: absent optional rows are simply
 * skipped, never a throw. A half-set-up account (no binding, no name, no
 * sessions) deletes as cleanly as a fully onboarded one.
